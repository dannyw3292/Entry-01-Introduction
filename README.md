<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Alrighty! The start of the independent study, what do I do? There was a lot to do but I settled on learning about Unity, Blender, and perhaps some C#. There were quite a bit of stuff for all three. Unity is a game engine, Blender's a 3-D modelling program, and C# is another coding language with similarities to Java and C++.</p>

<h1>Blender</h1>
<p>I personally wanted to do Blender ever since we did the 3-D modelling part of SEP-11. It was intriguing and fun yet it was so limiting with the tools we had available.</p>
