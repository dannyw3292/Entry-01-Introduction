#Independent Study of SEP 12
For the last semester of my senior year in the Software Engineering Program, I decided to primarily learn about Blender and Unity. I wanted to learn about creating models and implementing it into a game, combining some of my artistic ideas into the course.

##What is this?
These are weekly blog entries where I document everything I've learnt that week and what I've made.
