<h1>Week 3: Blender (again) </h1>

<h3>Re-cap!</h3>

-> Blender, rigging <br>
So, I have a model, now what? If you want to keep it as a still rendering, you're done! If you want to animate it, however, it's far from over. There has to be a rig for the model. In simpler terms, a rig is equivalent to the skeleton and all the muscles a human has, it allows us to move and what not.
<h3>Introducing Armatures!</h3>

These are the joints that make up the entire rig.
