<h1>Week 3: Blender (again) </h1>

<h3>Re-cap!</h3>

-> Blender, rigging <br>
So, I have a model, now what? If you want to keep it as a still rendering, you're done! If you want to animate it, however, it's far from over. There has to be a rig for the model. In simpler terms, a rig is equivalent to the skeleton and all the muscles a human has, it allows us to move and what not.
<h3>Introducing Armatures!</h3>

These are the joints that make up the entire rig.

The tutorials I've watched about creating a low poly model, almost all of them use a background image that has a front view and a side view of something. The model is "built" in the basic shape of the drawing itself and having both allows you to adjust the size and basic shapes to match that of the drawing. They also delete half of the initial block that they work with so they can apply the "Mirror" modifier so they can work on one side without worry.
