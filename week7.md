<h1>Week 7: Exporting Blender Files!</h1>

<h3>Recap!</h3>
It's nearly the end of the Independent Study project (two more weeks left!) and the first soft deadline is in two days, the school's Software Engineering Program Expo where all the students from various grade levels show off what they're most proud of. In our group's case (Shi Wei, Xavier, and me), we decided to go with our Independent Study project. What did that mean? A lot of crunching, Shi Wei started pushing for things to be done as best as we could to meet the deadline. For me, I was tasked with creating a fill-in model since he didn't want to use someone else's model as the player character so I went back to creating and rigging a simple model.
