<h1>Week 6: Rendering and Exporting</h1>

<h3>Recap from last week</h3>
Alright then, let's get started. During week 5, I was mainly just messing around, sculpting some random thing that apparently came up to 20+ megabytes (massive, I know). It wasn't all that much, a lot of it was just goofing about, that about sums it up really.

<h3> This week</h3>
What have I been doing this week? I started rendering a mountain and trying to export it, DAMN YOU FILE FORMATS FOR NOT SUPPORTING TEXTURES!!!! *cough* Excuse me. Back on track, with a deadline that my partner set for me and the actual hard deadline for this project to have a minimum viable product (in the form of something presentable for the school Expo where we show off projects that we're most proud of), I went back to rendering and modelling a landscape because that's what my partner, Shi Wei, needed as a part of our random simulation of sorts game thing.

<h4> Quick Description </h4>
In case you've forgotten what rendering is or I never explained it and you've gotten to this point, no need to worry because I'll explain it again. Rendering, in my own words, is creating a still object or model that is perfect for a photographing or animations, it looks appealing and is generally just a model without anything fancy compared to giving models a rig.
