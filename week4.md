<h1> Week 4: Modelling and Rigging</h1>

<h3>First off, Recap!</h3>
So what'd I do since last week. A lot of testing here and there in blender, watching tutorials on creating models and then beginning to rig them for animation purposes. A whole lot of stuff!

<h3> Rigs! </h3>
<h4>Quick description: What are they?</h4>
For most people that use Blender, many people create brilliant and stunning models that are static (still renderings, they don't move). If they wanted their creations to be allowed to move akin to that of a human or an animal, they'd give them what humans and animals all have in common, a skeleton or in Blender terms, a rig.
