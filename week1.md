<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Alrighty! The start of the independent study, what do I do? There was a lot to do but I settled on learning about Unity, Blender, and perhaps some C#. There were quite a bit of stuff for all three. Unity is a game engine, Blender's a 3D modelling program, and C# is another coding language with similarities to Java and C++.</p>

<h4>Topics that intrigued me!</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Blender</li>
  <li>Unity Engine</li>
  <li>(The lowest priority) C#</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is... Blender?</h3>
<p>Like what I've said already, Blender's a 3D modelling program, complex but of course, with complexity gives more you more options to work with. </p>

<p>You can make stuff like this, there are even more detailed models that other people have made. The picture above are low poly models. What is a low poly model you ask? Simple! They're just models that don't have many polygons (shapes that make up the overall model). </p>

<p>Basic shapes like simple rectangles, squares, triangles, and hexagons are used to make an extremely simple rendering of a model which are rendered relatively fast at the cost of being simplistic and ugly to some. If you want a more detailed model, you increase the poly count by large amounts. It makes the model look absolutely stunning and captivating but at the cost of slowly rendering.</p>
<br>
<p>Tutorials definitely help when trying to figure out how to do stuff, especially something so complex in the user interface and what it offers. The user interface is like a huge maze, it's so confusing from the start. As such, courtesy of Blender Guru with his beginner tutorials (*cough* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqeNA_4O0Qg&t=135s), I managed to learn a bit about Blender and some beginner tips. He goes through the basics like common hotkeys, explaining some of the features, he just makes the whole process easier to understand. One of them is using a modifier tool on an object and using something called "Subdivision Surface".</p>

<p> Ah wait, hold on. Let me take a couple steps back. When you create a new object, you have the option to change the segments of the object (simply increasing or decreasing the number of polygons right off the bat). The problem is by doing this, after you click away, it locks the number of segments that object has. While it does look nice, it slows down the rendering of your model. So.. you don't want that, you start with a low number of segments. But Danny, how do you change it if clicking away locks down the number of segments the object has? No worries! That's where Subdivision Surface comes along. It allows you to change the number of segments whenever you want to.</p>

<h3>What is... Unity?</h3>
<p>Again, it's a game engine. Compared to Blender, however, I haven't done much with Unity. It's complicated just like Blender in it's own way. From what I've said so far, it's primarily an engine with the majority of the tools built in for you to mess around and create something. The main coding language for Unity is C# though the coding aspect isn't a huge part of Unity.</p>

<p>I haven't really done anything with Unity besides make a single cube so yeah... I will have to use tutorials for this, definitely. So far, this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlKaB1etrik, has been helpful albeit I haven't watched too much of it yet.</p>

<h3>What is... C#?</h3>
<p>The last one! It's a coding language, one that Unity uses as it's primary language. To be quite honest, I have not done anything at all in regards to C# during this week. I was more focused on Blender and just a little bit of dabbling of Unity. What I have learned so far is that C9 with C#, no go. Gotta use something else. So, my friend and partner gave me the link to download the Visual Studio IDE for C#. Beyond downloading it, I haven't done anythng.</p>

<h1>Takeaways!</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Tutorials. Tutorials exist for these programs since they've been around for so long. You just need to find something that's easy to understand like with Blender Guru's tutorials. Brackeys' tutorial was also pretty good so far for Unity albeit he speaks pretty fast.</li>
  <li>Blender and Unity, user interfaces are complex. Definitely immerse yourself in learning the basic hotkeys and the UI to figure out stuff.</li>
