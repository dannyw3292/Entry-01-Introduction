<h1> Entry 2: Tinkering</h1>
<h3> First one, Unity! </h3>
<p> For the majority of this week, I've spent moving away from Blender and began tinkering with Unity.</p>
<p> Again, just like I did with Blender, I began learning the User Interface first. </p>

<h6>This was so confusing at first! Like, what were assets, what's a scene, what's the game tab difference?</h6>
<p> ..I had no clue what I was looking at for the day or two of starting up Unity and usually that's what most people encounter whenever we start learning a new program. So what did I start doing? Tutorials from people that knew what they were doing and have already gone through the initial learning phase!</p>
<p> And so, I found out some things about the interface of Unity and the slight similarities that both Blender and Unity have when it comes to creating objects and transforming them. The big difference in creating an object in Unity is that the object gets created and stored in the "Scene" folder which is on the left. Scenes may be confusing, simply think of scenes as levels. The object you make would, by default, be made in the first level and then changing the properties of that object will keep those changes exclusive to the first level.</p>
