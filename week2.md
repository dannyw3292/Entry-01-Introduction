<h1> Entry 2: Tinkering</h1>
<h3> First one, Unity! </h3>
<p> For the majority of this week, I've spent moving away from Blender and began tinkering with Unity.</p>
<p> Again, just like I did with Blender, I began learning the User Interface first. </p>

<h6>This was so confusing at first! Like, what were assets, what's a scene, what's the game tab difference?</h6>
<p> ..I had no clue what I was looking at for the day or two of starting up Unity and usually that's what most people encounter whenever we start learning a new program. So what did I start doing? Tutorials from people that knew what they were doing and have already gone through the initial learning phase!</p>
<p>The tutorial I used and followed for a bit was this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlKaB1etrik&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL&index=2.
<p> And so, I found out some things about the interface of Unity and the slight similarities that both Blender and Unity have when it comes to creating objects and transforming them. The big difference in creating an object in Unity is that the object gets created and stored in the "Scene" folder which is on the left. Scenes may be confusing, simply think of scenes as levels. The object you make would, by default, be made in the first level and then changing the properties of that object will keep those changes exclusive to the first level.</p>
<br>
<h3>Unity Physics</h3>
<p>When you create an object, it doesn't have any physics that would affect it. For example, I create a floor and then a block that's hovering above the floor, when I run the game, the block will just sit there, bored out of it's mind. How do I fix this? You use components, more specifically, the RigidBody component. By using this component, it allows the block to have physics. It will fall down to the floor and interact with the game and any other objects in the scene.</p>
<br>
<p> Beyond that, I haven't done much with Unity. According to the tutorial, to add anything else to the objects like movement, you would need scripts and for me, I feel that I have enough on my plate as it is. The only issue so far with Unity, I've no clue what I want to do with it compared to Blender.</p>

<h3>Blender now!</h3>
<p> The rest of the week and on my free time, I've read up on models and rigging it (giving the models a skeleton, if you will) which would allow it to be moved around and animated. I've also watched some videos (i.e. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK56ehoMVRo and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAfkQrGWn8A) that go into depth about creating low poly models which is probably the most feasible thing that I can do during this independent study.</p>
<p> Compared to tinkering with Unity however, I know exactly what I want to make with Blender. I want to start with something basic, rendering still objects (Blender Guru's donut tutorial). Then I want to move onto something that is simple but harder, creating a low poly model and then giving it a rig. Finally, if possible, I want to sculpt something by hand and also rig it but that's only if I can accomplish the low poly model. </p>

<h6>Example of a sculpted model above</h6>
<p>Besides reading on the different things that I can do with Blender, I've only tinkered a bit with the still object rendering and haven't tried much of the low poly/sculpting parts of Blender which is completely fine, it's best that I learn slow and understand it than try to rush in face-first into these two beasts of programs</p>

<h1>Takeaways!</h1>
<ul>
  <li> Be patient with learning something new. Ambition is nice and all but it's best if you tackle something new or a challenge one step at a time</li>
  <li>Know what you want to make or at least a very basic idea of it. This will help you a long way because you can narrow down what sort of learning you would need rather than just learning a bunch of things that don't help you at all.</li>
</ul>
