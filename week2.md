<h1> Entry 2: Tinkering</h1>
<h3> First one, Unity! </h3>
<p> For the majority of this week, I've spent moving away from Blender and began tinkering with Unity.</p>
<p> Again, just like I did with Blender, I began learning the User Interface first. </p>
<p> ..I had no clue what I was looking at for the day or two of starting up Unity. </p>

notes to self atm

alt click --> rotate camera
right click --> move camera
